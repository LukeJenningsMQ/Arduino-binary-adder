# Arduino-binary-adder
Arduino 4 bit binary adder I made, you can find the code, bill of materials and the design of circuit in this repository. 
# How it works
Steps:
1. Use the four buttons on the right to turn on and off the 4 LEDs above, these LEDs will act as the bits, LED on for a 1 and LED off for a 0. Since there are 4 buttons corresponding to the 4 LEDs, this means you can make a 4 bit binary nummber

2. Once you have choosen a 4 bit binary number, you can press the submit button, which is the button on the left of the 4 LED buttons.

3. Once submit button is pressed the LCD screen will display the deciamal and hexadecimal represenation of the number you submitted

4. Now you can put in the next 4 bit binary number you want to add to the first number you put in. Using the same process as the first number, by using buttons to create a 4 bit binary number and then pressing submit button

5. After submitting that number you will see the final equation with the answer in decimal and hexadecimal on the LCD screen. The answer in binary will appear on the 5 LED lights, if the LED is on its a 1 and if the LED is off its a 0.

6. You can press the submit button again to get back to the start and do a new equation.
